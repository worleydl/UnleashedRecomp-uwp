# Building

## 1. Clone the Repository

Clone **UnleashedRecomp** with submodules using [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp.git
```

### Windows
If you skipped the `--recurse-submodules` argument during cloning, you can run `update_submodules.bat` to ensure the submodules are pulled.

## 2. Add the Required Game Files

Copy the following files from the game and place them inside `./UnleashedRecompLib/private/`:
- `default.xex`
- `default.xexp`
- `shader.ar`

These files are located in the game's root directory, apart from `default.xexp`, which must be obtained via the title update package.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended that you install the game using [an existing Unleashed Recompiled release](https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp/releases/latest) to acquire these files, otherwise you'll need to rely on third-party tools to extract them.
>
> Using the Unleashed Recompiled installation wizard will also ensure that these files are compatible with each other so that they can be used with the build environment.
>
> When sourcing these files from an Unleashed Recompiled installation, they will be stored under `game` and `update` subdirectories.

## 3. Install Dependencies

### Windows
You will need to install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

In the installer, you must select the following **Workloads** and **Individual components** for installation:
- Desktop development with C++
- C++ Clang Compiler for Windows
- C++ CMake tools for Windows

### Linux
The following command will install the required dependencies on a distro that uses `apt` (such as Debian-based distros).
```bash
sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config curl cmake ninja-build clang clang-tools libgtk-3-dev
```
The following command will install the required dependencies on a distro that uses `pacman` (such as Arch-based distros).
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel ninja lld clang gtk3
```
You can also find the equivalent packages for your preferred distro.

> [!NOTE]
> This list may not be comprehensive for your particular distro and you may be required to install additional packages, should an error occur during configuration.

## 4. Build the Project
### UWP
Note: Make sure to update imgui & XenonRecomp to worleydl's `xenon-uwp` branches.  If you run into issues with fltused see the patch in this folder (we don't actually use the produced SDL2.dll in the UWP executable but we need it to build successfully!)

1. Use cmake with clang preset of your choice inside of VS Native Command prompt
2. Build project and copy required artifacts to `uwp/deps/` folder, see README inside deps folder for more info.
3. Build UWP solution in vs2022

### Windows
1. Open the repository directory in Visual Studio and wait for CMake generation to complete. If you don't plan to debug, switch to the `Release` configuration.

> [!TIP]
> If you need a Release-performant build and want to iterate on development without debugging, **it is highly recommended** that you use the `RelWithDebInfo` configuration for faster compile times.

2. Under **Solution Explorer**, right-click and choose **Switch to CMake Targets View**.
3. Right-click the **UnleashedRecomp** project and choose **Set as Startup Item**, then choose **Add Debug Configuration**.
4. Add a `currentDir` property to the first element under `configurations` in the generated JSON and set its value to the path to your game directory (where root is the directory containing `dlc`, `game`, `update`, etc).
5. Start **UnleashedRecomp**. The initial compilation may take a while to complete due to code and shader recompilation.

### Linux
1. Configure the project using CMake by navigating to the repository and running the following command.
```bash
cmake . --preset linux-release
```

> [!NOTE]
> The available presets are `linux-debug`, `linux-relwithdebinfo` and `linux-release`.

2. Build the project using the selected configuration.
```bash
cmake --build ./out/build/linux-release --target UnleashedRecomp
```

3. Navigate to the directory that was specified as the output in the previous step and run the game.
```bash
./UnleashedRecomp
```
